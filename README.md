Shed is an interesting card game, in Hungarian called "Holland kocsma".
You can play the game here: https://aniko-s.github.io/Shed_card_game/
You can play against the machine now, but I will develop it so users can play with each other.
I use Spring Boot for the back end and React.js for the front end.
